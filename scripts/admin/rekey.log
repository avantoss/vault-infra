Vault has created a new key, split into 5 key shares and a key threshold of 2.
These will not be active until after verification is complete. Please securely
distribute the key shares printed above. When Vault is re-sealed, restarted,
or stopped, you must supply at least 2 of these keys to unseal it before it
can start servicing requests.

Again, these key shares are _not_ valid until verification is performed.
Do not lose or discard your current key shares until after verification
is complete or you will be unable to unseal Vault. If you cancel the rekey
process or seal Vault before verification is complete the new shares will be
discarded and the current shares will remain valid.

The current verification status, including initial nonce, is shown below.
